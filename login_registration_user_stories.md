## User Story 3: Error Feedback on Login

**Title:**
_As a user, I want to receive clear feedback messages when I enter incorrect login credentials so that I know my login attempt was unsuccessful and can take appropriate action._

7. Error styling is consistent with application design system
8. Error message is accessible to screen readers

**Priority:** Medium
**Story Points:** 2
**Notes:**

- Consider rate limiting for production environments
- Provide hint about default credentials for demo purposes
- Ensure error states are visually distinct but not alarming

- **Session Management:** User sessions are maintained during active use but cleared on logout
- **Data Persistence:** Registration functionality is available for testing but credentials won't be saved for future login attempts
